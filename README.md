# CarboNo
This project was intended to be a website that helps the user keep track of their personal carbon footprint 
and provides the user with tips that help them reduce their carbon footprint.
Users can store a history of their CO2 usage through the website's Submit page and they are able to view a graphical representation 
of this data through the website's View page. 
The website keeps a log of the user's previous entries by reading the user's cookies. 
All data is locally stored on the user's machine. 

This project is hosted on Microsoft Azure.
The front-end is built using HTML and CSS.
The back-end is built using Python and the packages Flask and SQLAlchemy
